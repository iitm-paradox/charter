# Paradox Charter Repository

## Introduction

This repository contains the official version of the Paradox Charter, which outlines the fundamental principles, guidelines, and amendment processes governing the organization. The document in this repository is treated as the authoritative version, and any modifications to the charter are subject to a stringent approval process.

## Amendment Process

### Proposal Submission

- Proposed amendments must originate from the Secretaries.
- Amendments require unanimous support from every member of the Steering Committee and every Secretary before implementation.

### Review and Revision

- The Steering Committee and Secretaries have the option to reject the proposal with pertinent remarks.
- The Secretaries, along with the Steering Committee, may rewrite the proposal and resubmit it for review.
- This process is repeated until unanimous agreement is reached.

### Authority to Overrule

- Only the Head of Student Affairs has the authority to overrule the above conditions and accept the charter amendment proposal directly without a full house vote.

**Note:** The amendment process for both Department SOPs and the Charter will be the same.
